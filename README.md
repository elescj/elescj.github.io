# Jiaology-of-Datanova

Welcome to Jiaology of Datanova — my personal data science portfolio and learning lab. The name is 100% legitimate and definitely not a pun on my name and “data science.” (Nope. Not at all.)

Here, I explore data through hands-on projects, original analyses, and playful experiments that mix curiosity, creativity, and code. This repo is where I learn in public, sharpen my skills, and document my growth as an aspiring data scientist.

## About "Jiaology"

My name is Chuanjun Jiao, as also know as Charles Jiao. My dream rooted when I watched a cartoon about robots and automation back in the late 90s. And that dream never fades away throughout my growth in chemistry industry. I am amazed by how rich information can make a change in science, business, and would like to document my journey in utilizing my academic experience and picking up my childhood dream.

## What is Datanova?
