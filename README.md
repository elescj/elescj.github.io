# Jiaology-of-Datanova

Welcome to Jiaology of Datanova — my personal data science portfolio and learning lab. The name is 100% legitimate and definitely not a pun on my last name and “data science.” (Nope. Not at all.)

Here, I explore data through hands-on projects, original analyses, and playful experiments that mix curiosity, creativity, and code. This repo is where I learn in public, sharpen my skills, and document my growth as an aspiring data scientist.

## About "Jiaology"

"Jiaology" is a branch of my adventure concerned with my personal growth and skillset. It describes the variety of my knowledge landscape, defines the depth of my knowledgebase, and measures the altitude of my personal potential.

My name is Chuanjun Jiao, as also know as Charles Jiao. I enjoy acquiring new skills and enriching my experience. I hope I can make a difference on the world. (Talk about sports, prediction, automation.)

## About "Datanova"?

My enthusiasm rooted from a Sci-Fi cartoon that describes a future where robots and automation replaces most of the labor work. Despite the ultimate wish, I was deeply striked by the controversial fact that human lose basic capabality of daily life, when they cannot feed themselves. At that time, I was wishing automation to be productive and enhance human's capability.

I grow up into a sports fan who was crazy about stats. Basketball match up record isn't reliable. for example, the team stats such as inside scores, perimeter scores analyze strength and weakness, player play time fatiguesness and injury risk. Try with March madness didn't go well.

My career path drive into chemistry, and later equipment business. In common, predict reativity, or sales number? Explosion of AI and data science technology, my childhood dream, passion, professional experience, expand expertise and record my footprint.

I want to start with data science in business.
