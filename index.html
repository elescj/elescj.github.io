  <h1>Jiaology of Datanova</h1>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>Jiaology of Datanova</strong> — my personal data science portfolio and learning lab. The name is 100% legitimate and definitely not a pun on my last name and “data science.” (Nope. Not at all.)</p>
  <p>Here, I explore data through hands-on projects, original analyses, and playful experiments that mix curiosity, creativity, and code. This repo is where I learn in public, sharpen my skills, and document my growth as an aspiring data scientist.</p>

  <h2>About "Jiaology"</h2>
  <p>Jiaology is a branch of my personal adventure — a map of how I grow, what I learn, and where I’m headed. It charts the terrain of my curiosity, traces the depth of my knowledge, and gauges the altitude of my evolving potential.</p>
  <p>My name is Chuanjun Jiao, also known as Charles Jiao. I hold a Master of Science degree in Chemical Engineering and currently work in the medicinal chemistry industry, focusing on instrument product management. I'm an adventurer who is crazy about sports and finds joy in nature. My journey has led me to an unexpected yet perfectly fitting enthusiasm for data science — as we set out to unveil the big bang of "Datanova."</p>

  <h2>About "Datanova"</h2>
  <p>A successful sports forecast always deserves a little bragging — and I’ve been obsessed with predicting game outcomes since my teenage years. Back then, people relied on gut feeling, experience, and the occasional wild bias. But I believed something else: if Moneyball could build a champion team, surely a tournament could be statistically simulated — even if it felt too good to be true at the time.</p>
  <p>As a researcher, I once toyed with predicting chemical reaction outcomes using experimental data. The idea was sound, but the datasets were small, and the space between disciplines too wide. The tools just weren’t there yet.</p>
  <p>Now, almost unbelievably, it feels like the Big Bang of technology has happened in a blink. What used to be fantasy is becoming reality. Chemists are learning to code. Game results are deciphered through oceans of statistics. Automated reports, personalized insights, and lightning-fast business analysis are all powered by the extravagance of CRM data and cloud computation.</p>
  <p>Datanova is the cosmic chapter of my journey — a portfolio born from this transformation. It’s where I expand my skills, revisit the unfinished stories of my youth, and explore new intersections between industries. Each project is a star in this constellation — from visual storytelling and statistical modeling to data wrangling and machine learning.</p>
  <p>It is a process of learning by doing, building by breaking, and documenting it all along the way.</p>
