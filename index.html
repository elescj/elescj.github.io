  <h1>Jiaometry in Jupyter</h1>
  <p>Welcome to <strong> Jiaometry in Jupyter</strong> — my personal data science portfolio and learning lab. The name is 100% legitimate and definitely not a pun on my last name and “data science.” (Nope. Not at all.)</p>
  <p>Here, I explore data through hands-on projects, original analyses, and playful experiments that mix curiosity, creativity, and code. This is where I learn in public, sharpen my skills, and document my journey as an aspiring data scientist.</p>

  <h2>About "Jiaology"</h2>
  <p>Jiaometry is more than just unfolding dimensions, reading data shapes, or decoding patterns through visualization. It’s about measuring how far this journey goes — a personal geometry of growth, insight, and exploration. It reflects the angles of learning, the structure of problem-solving, and the space of possibility that data science opens up.</p>
  <p>My name is Chuanjun Jiao, also known as Charles Jiao. I hold a Master of Science degree in Chemical Engineering and currently work in the medicinal chemistry industry, focusing on instrument product management. I’m also an adventurer at heart — crazy about sports, fascinated by nature, and always chasing the next challenge. Somewhere along the way, that curiosity led me to data science — a field I never planned for, but now feels like a perfect fit.</p>

  <h2>From Curiosity to Coordinates — a Personal Launch into the Data Universe</h2>
  <p>Successful sports forecasts deserve bragging rights — ask any fan. My obsession with prediction started early in my teenage years, back when most people relied on intuition, experience, and the occasional biased hunch. But I believed otherwise: if Moneyball could assemble a champion team, surely an entire tournament could be simulated — even if that felt too good to be true at the time.</p>
  <p>Later, as a researcher, I flirted with the idea of predicting chemical reactions using experimental data. But the datasets were too small, and the gap between disciplines too wide to bridge with the tools I had.</p>
  <p>Then came the Big Bang of modern data science. Suddenly, what felt like science fiction became reality: Chemists became coders. Games became simulations. Businesses turned data into rocket fuel. So I decided: it’s time to get my feet wet — and dive in.</p>

  <h2>Jupyter and Beyond</h2>
  <p>A craftsman is only as good as his tools. And for this mission, I launched straight into Jupyter — the place where ideas become code, and code becomes insight.</p>
  <p>🧰 Notable Tools:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pandas – Data manipulation & cleaning</li>
    <li>NumPy – Numerical computation</li>
    <li>Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn – Machine learning</li>
    <li>Statsmodels – Statistical modeling (e.g., OLS, VIF)</li>
    <li>SciPy – Probability & hypothesis testing</li>
    <li>Pylab – Plotting and exploratory math</li>
  </ul>
  <p>🧪 Techniques:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clustering</li>
    <li>Linear Regression</li>
    <li>Data Exploration</li>
    <li>Statistical Testing</li>
    <li>Feature Engineering</li>
  </ul>
