  <h1>Jiaometry in Jupyter</h1>
  <p>Welcome toâ€¯<strong> Jiaometry in Jupyter</strong> â€” my personal data science portfolio and learning lab. The name is 100% legitimate and definitely not a pun on my last name and data science. (Nope. Not at all.)</p>
  <p>Here, I explore data through hands-on projects, original analyses, and playful experiments that mix curiosity, creativity, and code. This is where I learn in public, sharpen my skills, and document my journey as an aspiring data scientist.</p>

  <h2>About "Jiaometry"</h2>
  <p>Jiaometry is more than just unfolding dimensions, sketching data shapes, or drawing conclusions from noisy curves. Itâ€™s about finding structure in uncertainty, tracing the arc of growth, and triangulating meaning across every dataset I explore.</p>
  <p>My name is Chuanjun Jiao, also known as Charles Jiao. I hold a Master of Science degree in Chemical Engineering and currently work in the medicinal chemistry industry, focusing on instrument product management. Iâ€™m also an adventurer at heart â€” crazy about sports, fascinated by nature, and always chasing the next challenge. Somewhere along the way, that curiosity led me to data science â€” a field I never planned for, but now feels like a perfect fit.</p>

  <h2>From Curiosity to Coordinates â€” a Personal Launch into the Data Universe</h2>
  <p>Successful sports forecasts deserve bragging rights â€” ask any fan. My obsession with prediction started early in my teenage years, back when most people relied on intuition, experience, and the occasional biased hunch. But I believed otherwise: if Moneyball could assemble a champion team, surely an entire tournament could be simulated â€” even if that felt too good to be true at the time.</p>
  <p>Later, as a researcher, I flirted with the idea of predicting chemical reactions using experimental data. But the datasets were too small, and the gap between disciplines too wide to bridge with the tools I had.</p>
  <p>Then came the Big Bang of modern data science. Suddenly, what felt like science fiction became reality: Chemists became coders. Games became simulations. Businesses turned data into rocket fuel. So I decided: itâ€™s time to get my feet wet â€” and dive in.</p>

  <h2>Jupyter and Beyond</h2>
  <p>A craftsman is only as good as his tools. And for this mission, I launched straight into Jupyter â€” the place where ideas become code, and code becomes insight.</p>
  <p>ðŸ§° Notable Tools:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pandas â€“ Data manipulation & cleaning</li>
    <li>NumPy â€“ Numerical computation</li>
    <li>Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Visualization</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning</li>
    <li>Statsmodels â€“ Statistical modeling (e.g., OLS, VIF)</li>
    <li>SciPy â€“ Probability & hypothesis testing</li>
    <li>Pylab â€“ Plotting and exploratory math</li>
  </ul>
  <p>ðŸ§ª Techniques:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clustering</li>
    <li>Linear Regression</li>
    <li>Data Exploration</li>
    <li>Statistical Testing</li>
    <li>Feature Engineering</li>
  </ul>
