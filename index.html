  <h1>Jiaometry in Jupyter</h1>
  <p>Welcome toâ€¯<strong> Jiaometry in Jupyter</strong> â€” my personal data science portfolio and learning lab. The name is 100% legitimate and definitely not a pun on my last name and data science. (Nope. Not at all.)</p>
  <p>Jiaometry is more than just unfolding dimensions, sketching data shapes, or drawing conclusions from noisy curves. Itâ€™s about finding structure in uncertainty, tracing the arc of growth, and triangulating meaning across every dataset I explore.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Chuanjun Jiao, also known as Charles Jiao. I hold a Master of Science degree in Chemical Engineering and currently work in the medicinal chemistry industry, focusing on instrument product management. Iâ€™m also an adventurer at heart â€” crazy about sports, fascinated by nature, and always chasing the next challenge. Somewhere along the way, my passion lead to a tremendous curiosity in exploring data science.</p>

  <h2>To Jupyter and Beyond</h2>
  <p>A craftsman is only as good as his tools. Fueled by Python, I launched straight into Jupyter â€” the place where ideas become code, and code becomes insight.</p>
  <p>The datasets are managed by mathematical packages such as Pandas, NumPy, and visualized by packages such as Matplotlib. Mathematical skills are honed </p>
