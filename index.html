  <h1>Jiaometry in Jupyter</h1>
  <p>Welcome to <strong> Jiaometry in Jupyter</strong> — my personal data science portfolio and learning lab. The name is 100% legitimate and definitely not a pun on my last name and data science. (Nope. Not at all.)</p>

  <div class="banner1"></div>

  <h2>About "Jiaometry"</h2>
  <p>Jiaometry is more than just unfolding dimensions, sketching data shapes, or drawing conclusions from noisy curves. It’s about finding structure in uncertainty, tracing the arc of growth, and triangulating meaning across every dataset I explore.</p>
  <p>My name is Chuanjun Jiao, also known as Charles Jiao. I hold a Master of Science degree in Chemical Engineering and currently work in the medicinal chemistry industry, focusing on instrument product management. Fascinated by the explosive growth in data technology, I've come to realize that data science intersects naturally with my professional work, academic background, and even my hobbies.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In business, data helps assess pipelines and decisions more mathematically than emotionally.</li>
    <li>In chemistry, scientists are becoming ambidextrous — fluent in both experiments and code.</li>
    <li>In sports, statistics reveal patterns long buried in box scores.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If Moneyball can assemble a champion team, why can’t I level up my game — in the office and on the field?</p>

  <h2>To Jupyter and Beyond</h2>
  <p>Fueled by Python, the mission launches into Jupyter — and extends beyond. This is where applications collide with ideas, and scripts crunch the numbers that reveal insight. Public datasets are manipulated by Pandas and NumPy. Patterns are decoded by Matplotlib and Seaborn. Hidden stories emerge through regression, classification, and clustering.</p>
