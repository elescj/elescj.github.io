  <h1>Jiaology of Datanova</h1>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>Jiaology of Datanova</strong> — my personal data science portfolio and learning lab. The name is 100% legitimate and definitely not a pun on my last name and “data science.” (Nope. Not at all.)</p>
  <p>Here, I explore data through hands-on projects, original analyses, and playful experiments that mix curiosity, creativity, and code. This repo is where I learn in public, sharpen my skills, and document my growth as an aspiring data scientist.</p>

  <h2>About "Jiaology"</h2>
  <p>Jiaology is a branch of my personal adventure — a map of how I grow, what I learn, and where I’m headed. It charts the terrain of my curiosity, traces the depth of my knowledge, and gauges the altitude of my evolving potential.</p>
  <p>My name is Chuanjun Jiao, also known as Charles Jiao. I hold a Master of Science degree in Chemical Engineering and currently work in the medicinal chemistry industry, focusing on instrument product management. I'm an adventurer who is crazy about sports and finds joy in nature. My journey has led me to an unexpected yet perfectly fitting enthusiasm for data science — as we set out to unveil the big bang of "Datanova."</p>

  <h2>About "Datanova"</h2>
  <p>Successful sports forecasts deserve bragging rights — ask any fan. My obsession with prediction started early in my teenage years, back when most people relied on intuition, experience, and the occasional biased hunch. But I believed otherwise: if Moneyball could assemble a champion team, surely an entire tournament could be simulated — even if that felt too good to be true at the time.</p>
  <p>Later, as a researcher, I flirted with the idea of predicting chemical reactions using experimental data. But the datasets were too small, and the gap between disciplines too wide to bridge with the tools I had.</p>
  <p>Then, seemingly in a blink, the Big Bang of technology arrived. What once felt like fantasy is now unfolding in real time. Chemists are evolving into coders. Game outcomes are foretold by oceans of statistics. Personalized reports, deep business analyses, and lightning-fast insights are powered by the extravagance of CRM data and modern computation.</p>
  <p>Datanova is the cosmic chapter of my journey — this portfolio is a constellation of that transformation: the expansion of my skill set, the revival of old fascinations, and the crossing into new industries. Each project is a star reflecting my growth as a data explorer. From visual storytelling and statistical modeling to data wrangling and machine learning, I’m learning by doing, building by breaking, and documenting it all along the way.</p>
