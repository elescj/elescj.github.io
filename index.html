  <h1>Jiaometry in Jupyter</h1>
  <p>Welcome to‚ÄØ<strong> Jiaometry in Jupyter</strong> ‚Äî my personal data science portfolio and learning lab. The name is 100% legitimate and definitely not a pun on my last name and data science. (Nope. Not at all.)</p>
  <p>Jiaometry is more than just unfolding dimensions, sketching data shapes, or drawing conclusions from noisy curves. It‚Äôs about finding structure in uncertainty, tracing the arc of growth, and triangulating meaning across every dataset I explore.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Chuanjun Jiao, also known as Charles Jiao. I hold a Master of Science degree in Chemical Engineering and currently work in the medicinal chemistry industry, focusing on instrument product management. I‚Äôm also an adventurer at heart ‚Äî crazy about sports, fascinated by nature, and always chasing the next challenge. Somewhere along the way, that curiosity led me to data science ‚Äî a field I never planned for, but now feels like a perfect fit.</p>

  <p>My obsession with prediction started in my teenage years, when most people relied on intuition, experience, or the occasional biased hunch to forecast game results. But I believed otherwise: if Moneyball could assemble a champion team, surely an entire tournament could be simulated ‚Äî even if that felt too good to be true at the time.</p>
  <p>Later, as a researcher, I flirted with the idea of predicting chemical reactions using experimental data. But the datasets were too small, and the gap between disciplines too wide to bridge with the tools I had.</p>
  <p>Then came the Big Bang of modern data science. Suddenly, what once felt like science fiction became reality: Chemists became coders. Games became simulations. Businesses turned data into rocket fuel. So I decided: it was time to get my feet wet ‚Äî and dive in.</p>

  <h2>Jupyter and Beyond</h2>
  <p>A craftsman is only as good as his tools. And for this mission, I launched straight into Jupyter ‚Äî the place where ideas become code, and code becomes insight.</p>
