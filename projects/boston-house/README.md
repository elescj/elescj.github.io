## 🧠 Overview
This project implements a supervised learning pipeline to predict housing prices in the Boston metropolitan area using the classic Boston Housing dataset. Leveraging multiple linear regression, it models the relationship between housing prices and a range of explanatory variables including crime rate, average number of rooms, accessibility to highways, and more. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation using regression metrics such as RMSE and 𝑅2R 2 . The objective is to assess the effectiveness of linear regression in modeling continuous housing price data and to interpret the influence of individual predictors on pricing outcomes.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Estimating house prices accurately is a persistent challenge due to the many factors that influence real estate markets, including property characteristics and neighborhood attributes. This project aims to build a linear regression model that can predict housing prices in Boston based on key variables in the dataset. The objective is to minimize prediction error while interpreting which features have the most impact on price, providing a foundational approach to housing market analysis.
