## 🧠 Overview
This project implements a supervised learning pipeline to predict housing prices in the Boston metropolitan area using the classic Boston Housing dataset. It models the relationship between housing prices and a range of explanatory variables including crime rate, average number of rooms, accessibility to highways, and more. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation using regression metrics such as RMSE and 𝑅2. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of linear regression in modeling continuous housing price data and to interpret the influence of individual predictors on pricing outcomes.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Accurately estimating housing prices is a persistent challenge due to the numerous and often interrelated factors that influence real estate markets — particularly the issue of multicollinearity among predictors. This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict housing prices in Boston using key features from the dataset. The objective is to minimize prediction error while identifying the most influential variables, offering a foundational, interpretable baseline for housing price modeling and further machine learning applications.
