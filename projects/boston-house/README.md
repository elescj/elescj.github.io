## üß† Overview
This project implements a supervised learning pipeline to predict housing prices in the Boston metropolitan area using the classic Boston Housing dataset. It models the relationship between housing prices and a range of explanatory variables including crime rate, average number of rooms, accessibility to highways, and more. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation using regression metrics such as RMSE and ùëÖ2. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of linear regression in modeling continuous housing price data and to interpret the influence of individual predictors on pricing outcomes.

## üìä Dataset
The data and problem were provided by the *Applied Data Science Program* by MIT. The dataset is a **506 √ó 13** CSV file, where each row represents a residential property in a suburb or town of Boston. It was originally drawn from the **Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970**.

Each record includes **13 input features** describing property and neighborhood characteristics, and one **target variable**: the median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s).

Detailed feature descriptions are listed in the table below:
| Feature   | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CRIM`    | Per capita crime rate by town                                               |
| `ZN`      | Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.           |
| `INDUS`   | Proportion of non-retail business acres per town                            |
| `CHAS`    | Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)       |
| `NOX`     | Nitric Oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)                          |
| `RM`      | The average number of rooms per dwelling                                    |
| `AGE`     | Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940                        |
| `DIS`     | Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers                        |
| `RAD`     | Index of accessibility to radial highways                                   |
| `TAX`     | Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000                                    |
| `PTRATIO` | Pupil-teacher ratio by town                                                 |
| `LSTAT`   | Percentage of lower status population                                       |
| `MEDV`    | Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable)            |

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Accurately estimating housing prices is a persistent challenge due to the numerous and often interrelated factors that influence real estate markets ‚Äî particularly the issue of multicollinearity among predictors. This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict housing prices in Boston using key features from the dataset. The objective is to minimize prediction error while identifying the most influential variables, offering a foundational, interpretable baseline for housing price modeling and further machine learning applications.

## üîé Methodology
The following steps outline the end-to-end process used in this project:

1. **Data Overview**  
   The Boston Housing dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame for preliminary inspection. Key characteristics such as data dimensions, data types, presence of duplicates or null values, and the number of unique values per feature were assessed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Univariate analysis** was conducted to understand the distribution of each feature using histograms and descriptive statistics.  
   - **Bivariate analysis** explored relationships between independent variables and the target (`MEDV`) using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps, helping to identify potential multicollinearity and feature relevance.

3. **Model Building ‚Äì Linear Regression**  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80/20).  
   - Examined multicollinearity using correlation matrices and VIF; dropped highly collinear features.  
   - Built an initial linear regression model and evaluated coefficient significance.  
   - Removed statistically insignificant variables to improve model interpretability and re-fit the model.  
   - Verified linear regression assumptions (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, independence).  
   - Evaluated model performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.  
   - Applied **k-fold cross-validation** to assess model generalizability.  
   - Constructed the final linear regression model based on refined features and evaluation metrics.
